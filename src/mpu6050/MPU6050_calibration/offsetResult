Sensor readings with offsets:	8	3	16393	1	-1	0

Your offsets:	-4040	-148	1346	21	16	2


Data is printed as: acelX acelY acelZ giroX giroY giroZ

Check that your sensor readings are close to 0 0 16384 0 0 0

If calibration was succesful write down your offsets so you can set them in your projects using something similar to mpu.setXAccelOffset(youroffset)
